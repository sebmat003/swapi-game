Using SWAPI: https://www.swapi.tech/

Build an application to select random people or starships and render their details to see
who would win based on a common attribute.
i.e. people have mass and starships have crew. A person with greater mass wins, a
starship with more crew wins.
The app should render the attributes from the resource in a simple web page that allows
you to 'play' the game.
Once two cards are displayed the app should declare one of the cards a winner based on
the higher common attribute.
Having displayed the winning card, the user should be able to play again using an action
button that repeats the same request.

Bonus points!
These are not required, just adds to your portfolio in an interview:

1. Score counter. If there are two players, left and right, show how many times each side
   has won.
2. Option to select which resource to play against
3. Use Angular Material and display the details in a card
